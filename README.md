A text-based version of the classic TV gameshow
### Spin the Wheel!
- Go it alone in a solo game or challenge as many friends as you want to take it in turns guessing letters in around 1,000 words and phrases
- Pick a name and decide how many rounds you want to play
- Spin the wheel and guess consonants to rack up points which you can spend on vowels to help decipher any tricky words
- Don't get greedy or you could lose a turn or even go bankrupt!

### Final Round
- The player with the most points at the end of the main game gets the opportunity to play the final round
- Get R, S, T, L, N and E for free then choose an additional three consonants and a vowel
- Think carefully as you only get one chance to guess the correct word or phrase!
